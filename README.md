# NC Balance of State CoC HMIS Dashboard - PROJECT DOCUMENTATION #
### Project Understanding ###
My understanding of the overall project is that the dashboard was created by ICA some time ago and is live.  However, it requires regular maintenance in the form of data pulls from HMIS monthly, processing through a tableau flow and pushes to tableau server, which have not been completed in some time.  Additionally, there are some tecnical bugs in the dashboard that prevent it from functioning properly, which is the reason it hasn't been maintained.  

My job is to resolve these issues and get it back up and working by the end of April for the use of our project members for an upcoming project.  Specific tasks for accomplishing this are included in smartsheets here: https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/cx4Phq344XpWWQXPRvxXC6HcpqFG8qXMR5RGJ981?view=grid&filterId=6521353234868100

## PLAN OF ATTACK (inc. Status Updates) ## 
* Eyes on Tableau 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning Saturday Night and throughtout all day Sunday I dove into this. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reviewed the smartsheet tasks
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reviewed the ICA guidebook
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reviewed the tableau data flow for processing the data
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reviewed the tableau desktop file for building the dashboard
* Demonstrate Understanding of Problem 
* Create Timeline to Completion; calendar blocking
* Run Dashboard Update as-is and witness problems
* Attack smartsheet tasks 1-at-a-time; proceed when previous task is complete and no longer issue in dash (unless issue is dependent on another downstream task)
* QA complete and working dash 
* Provide link and status to Andrea when complete
